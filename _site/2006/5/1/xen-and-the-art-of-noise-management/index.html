         <div class="entrybody"><p>While I definitely appreciate the folks at [Textdrive](http://www.textdrive.com) for being early, and continuing, supporters of [Rails](www.rubyonrails.com), I recently decided to switch to a <span class="caps">VDS</span> for essentially the same reasons as [Octopod](http://outside-thoughts.octopod.info/articles/2006/02/22/why-the-move). Actually, I have him to thank for that little extra nudge provided by his blog entry. I hadn&#8217;t given the idea much thought until then because it seemed like overkill for hosting a couple personal sites. Silly me.</p>
<p>After quite a bit of research, I decided to go with [Quantact](http://www.quantact.com) as well. And thanks to Ezra&#8217;s great [tutorial](http://brainspl.at/rails_stack.html), I&#8217;m up and enjoying myself a lot. Well, mostly. I decided to use Debian 3.1, which I&#8217;ve never used before. However, since I&#8217;ve been using [Ubuntu](www.ubuntu.com) for the past several months (which was a pretty big switch after RH and Fedora for years), the process was mostly painless. The one area I&#8217;m not real comfortable with is the firewall. I&#8217;m using Bastille, but I haven&#8217;t closed the book on that yet. Actually, the idea that&#8217;s pinging around in my head is: I wonder how it would work to use Rake to write the rules for iptables. Has anyone tried something like this? I&#8217;ll let you know what I discover.</p>
<p>Okay, you might be wondering how the title fits in here. If you&#8217;ve checked out [Quantact](http://www.quantact.com), you may have noticed they are using [Xen](http://www.xensource.com/) for the <span class="caps">VDS</span>. Impressive technology. The rest? Well, when evaluating what I was finding most unsatisfactory about shared hosting, I realized it was the &#8220;noise&#8221;. All these processes, all these directories, all this stuff going on that had nothing to do with me. I was spending a lot of time in that noise, especially that webmin interface when I just wanted to type a few lines and be done. Now ps aux fills less than one screen of my xterm. I don&#8217;t think about special cases or file tickets for a port. Mind you, I&#8217;m not saying Textdrive has it all wrong. I&#8217;m just saying, my Xen <span class="caps">VDS</span> is nice and quiet.<br />
