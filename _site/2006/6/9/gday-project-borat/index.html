      </div>

         <div class="entrybody"><p>Yesterday, Project Borat and I were formally introduced. I&#8217;ll be the lead developer, picking up the [thread](http://peat.org/articles/2006/05/03/introducing-project-borat) and, along with [Robby](http://www.robbyonrails.com/articles/2006/05/03/project-borat-an-introduction), I&#8217;ll continue to entertain you with insights we gain as we delve deeply into the process, knocking some moss off a few rocks and uncovering ideas that will work well for us and our clients.</p>
<p>As this project is just getting under way, one of the first things we&#8217;re facing is&#8230; hmm, I hate to label it because along with that label comes all sorts of assumptions. Sure, we could call it requirements gathering, but that doesn&#8217;t tell the whole story. Then there are stories, use cases, method <span class="caps">XYZ</span>, and better mention <span class="caps">PQR</span> for completeness. Before you run off googling those last two, I made them up. Point is, even though there is a lot of material on processes, and I&#8217;m learning more every day, it&#8217;s just not that simple.</p>
<p>So, today [Robby](http://robbyonrails.com) and I took a quick jaunt over to one of my favorite places on the planet. How cool to work this [close](http://rubyurl.com/jmM) to [Powells Technical Books](http://www.powells.com/technicalbooks). While he&#8217;s deep into today&#8217;s [acquisition](http://www.robbyonrails.com/articles/2006/06/08/trawling-for-requirements),  [Mastering the Requirements Process, 2nd Ed](http://www.powells.com/biblio/71-0321419499-0), I had my own [surprise](http://rubyurl.com/uGg) waiting on my doorstep this evening.</p>
<p>That brings me to one point about gathering requirements: the first value listed on the [agile manifesto](http://agilemanifesto.org/)&#8212;&#8220;Individuals and interactions over processes and tools&#8221;. I&#8217;m guessing there&#8217;s more than a few reasons why that one is listed first.</p>
<p>Clients are people with varied backgrounds. If we are slaves to a particular methodology, we either 1) talk over the client&#8217;s head with unintelligible jargon, 2) try to coerce the client into &#8220;learning&#8221; our methodology so we can &#8220;be on the same page&#8221;, or 3) continually translate, in the back of our heads or on our notes, what the client is saying into our method&#8217;s jargon. The first two are disrespectful, the last one error prone. (Where&#8217;s the feedback that must occur for checking understanding?)</p>
<p>When we, as developers, began focusing on user-centric design and usability, it was a recognition that users deserved respect and need not be rescued, if you will, by our bright ideas. In a big way, we needed to keep our bright ideas out of the user&#8217;s way. In the same way, I&#8217;m not convinced I should expect a client to care about stories, use cases, or <span class="caps">XYZ</span> artifact. I do believe my role is to facilitate a client&#8217;s understanding of what they want and capture that as faithfully as possible.</p>
<p>I think plain ol&#8217; natural language is probably the most valuable tool for that. &#8220;Ee gads, but natural language is fraught with ambiguities, imprecision, double meanings, and all things evil,&#8221; you say. Well, perhaps. But consider this: mathematics is probably the most precise form of &#8220;language&#8221; humans have yet devised, and plain ol&#8217; natural language suffices to convey mathematics given a couple rules of usage</p>
<p>First, we do try to eliminate ambiguity and imprecision with definitions. If I&#8217;m talking about a metric space, I begin with, &#8220;given a set X and a metric d, (X,d)&#8221;. There, no more ambiguity. And second, economy; introduce a symbol or name to mean a particularly well-defined concept. Add a dose of discipline, be conscientious about usage, and you can get very far using normal language to discuss very difficult concepts. Trust me, or visit a math class and watch people learning math.</p>
<p>So, that&#8217;s the first of my explorations. How far can natural language take me before I start reaching for this or that &#8220;representation&#8221;? I&#8217;ll aim to keep these posts short and pithy in the future, but thanks for ambling along with me on this one.<br />
