        <p><span class="date">09 June 2006</span></p>
      </div>

         <div class="entrybody"><p>Yesterday, Project Borat and I were formally introduced. I&rsquo;ll be the lead developer, picking up the <a href="http://peat.org/articles/2006/05/03/introducing-project-borat">thread</a> and, along with <a href="http://www.robbyonrails.com/articles/2006/05/03/project-borat-an-introduction">Robby</a>, I&rsquo;ll continue to entertain you with insights we gain as we delve deeply into the process, knocking some moss off a few rocks and uncovering ideas that will work well for us and our clients.</p>

<p>As this project is just getting under way, one of the first things we&rsquo;re facing is&hellip; hmm, I hate to label it because along with that label comes all sorts of assumptions. Sure, we could call it requirements gathering, but that doesn&rsquo;t tell the whole story. Then there are stories, use cases, method XYZ, and better mention PQR for completeness. Before you run off googling those last two, I made them up. Point is, even though there is a lot of material on processes, and I&rsquo;m learning more every day, it&rsquo;s just not that simple.</p>

<p>So, today <a href="http://robbyonrails.com">Robby</a> and I took a quick jaunt over to one of my favorite places on the planet. How cool to work this <a href="http://rubyurl.com/jmM">close</a> to <a href="http://www.powells.com/technicalbooks">Powells Technical Books</a>. While he&rsquo;s deep into today&rsquo;s <a href="http://www.robbyonrails.com/articles/2006/06/08/trawling-for-requirements">acquisition</a>,  <a href="http://www.powells.com/biblio/71-0321419499-0">Mastering the Requirements Process, 2nd Ed</a>, I had my own <a href="http://rubyurl.com/uGg">surprise</a> waiting on my doorstep this evening.</p>

<p>That brings me to one point about gathering requirements: the first value listed on the <a href="http://agilemanifesto.org/">agile manifesto</a>&ndash;&ldquo;Individuals and interactions over processes and tools&rdquo;. I&rsquo;m guessing there&rsquo;s more than a few reasons why that one is listed first.</p>

<p>Clients are people with varied backgrounds. If we are slaves to a particular methodology, we either 1) talk over the client&rsquo;s head with unintelligible jargon, 2) try to coerce the client into &ldquo;learning&rdquo; our methodology so we can &ldquo;be on the same page&rdquo;, or 3) continually translate, in the back of our heads or on our notes, what the client is saying into our method&rsquo;s jargon. The first two are disrespectful, the last one error prone. (Where&rsquo;s the feedback that must occur for checking understanding?)</p>

<p>When we, as developers, began focusing on user-centric design and usability, it was a recognition that users deserved respect and need not be rescued, if you will, by our bright ideas. In a big way, we needed to keep our bright ideas out of the user&rsquo;s way. In the same way, I&rsquo;m not convinced I should expect a client to care about stories, use cases, or XYZ artifact. I do believe my role is to facilitate a client&rsquo;s understanding of what they want and capture that as faithfully as possible.</p>

<p>I think plain ol&rsquo; natural language is probably the most valuable tool for that. &ldquo;Ee gads, but natural language is fraught with ambiguities, imprecision, double meanings, and all things evil,&rdquo; you say. Well, perhaps. But consider this: mathematics is probably the most precise form of &ldquo;language&rdquo; humans have yet devised, and plain ol&rsquo; natural language suffices to convey mathematics given a couple rules of usage. </p>

<p>First, we do try to eliminate ambiguity and imprecision with definitions. If I&rsquo;m talking about a metric space, I begin with, &ldquo;given a set X and a metric d, (X,d)&rdquo;. There, no more ambiguity. And second, economy; introduce a symbol or name to mean a particularly well-defined concept. Add a dose of discipline, be conscientious about usage, and you can get very far using normal language to discuss very difficult concepts. Trust me, or visit a math class and watch people learning math.</p>

<p>So, that&rsquo;s the first of my explorations. How far can natural language take me before I start reaching for this or that &ldquo;representation&rdquo;? I&rsquo;ll aim to keep these posts short and pithy in the future, but thanks for ambling along with me on this one.</p>
