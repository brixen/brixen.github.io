         <div class="entrybody"><p>Last week, my esteemed colleague [Jeremy](http://www.jvoorhis.com), at his characteristic morning unveiling<sup><sup class="footnote" id="fnr1"><a href="#fn1">1</a></sup></sup>, brought in a couple books on &#8220;Death March&#8221; projects. While he tackled the other, he lent me </p>
<p>Under the heading, <em>Why Do Death March Projects Happen</em>, Edward starts off with a great quote by the author of the <em>Dilbert</em> cartoons, Scott Adams:</p>
<p>&gt;When I first started hearing these stories [about irrational corporate behavior] I was puzzled, but after careful analysis I have developed a sophisticated theory to explain the existence of this bizarre workplace behavior. People are idiots.</p>
<p>&gt;Including me. Everyone is an idiot, not just the people with low <span class="caps">SAT</span> scores. The only difference among us is that we&#8217;re idiots about different things at different times. No matter how smart you are, you spend much of your day being an idiot.</p>
<p>Hopefully everyone is not totally insulted at this point. As in <em>Dilbert</em>, this idea can be a great source of inspiration. It&#8217;s really not as derogatory or as hopeless as it sounds. And for me, it puts some recent events in perspective.</p>
<p>Since DHH&#8217;s keynote at RailsConf, there has been noticeable buzz about <span class="caps">CRUD</span>. Everything from [new acronyms](http://jimonwebgames.com/articles/2006/06/26/dont-say-crud-say-fucd) to [debates](http://www.jvoorhis.com/articles/2006/06/28/journaled-domain-models-via-the-command-pattern-or-its-all-just-crud-pt-ii) about [nouns versus verbs](http://blog.jasonwatkins.net/articles/2006/06/27/are-nouns-better-than-verbs). All good stuff, interesting, thought provoking. But for me, probably the greatest benefit of more CRUDful modeling is better managing of complexity. I think this is the raison d&#8217;Ãªtre of <span class="caps">CRUD</span>.</p>
<p>Similar to when <span class="caps">OOP</span> was capturing hearts and minds, many people waxed poetic about reuse, more faithful domain modeling, etc. But the golden egg of <span class="caps">OOP</span> is encapsulation, and encapsulation is another powerful abstraction that helps manage complexity. If there were one thing I would lobby to be added to the agile manifesto, it would be &#8220;Simplicity over big, amazing, mind-boggling complexity&#8221;. Certainly, the &#8220;less software&#8221; mantra is related to this, but even a tiny piece of software does not necessarily mean simple, not complex.</p>
<p>So, if you notice your controller method count is ballooning, or your controllers are more cross-wired than your plate of spaghetti, you might see an opportunity for using <span class="caps">CRUD</span> to restore sanity. But you can also ruthlessly adopt Einstein&#8217;s wisdom at every stage of development and use <span class="caps">CRUD</span> to make your app as simple as possible, but not simpler.</p>

<p><sup><sup class="footnote" id="fnr1"><a href="#fn1">1</a></sup></sup> Jeremy often comes to work with an announce if you will. For instance, one day we were discussing something about languages; I mentioned Erlang. The next day Jeremy announces when he arrived, &#8220;I learned Erlang last night.&#8221; Sweet!<br />
