         <div class="entrybody"><p>We all love the spluge (spam deluge), don&#8217;t we? Usually spam is so abnoxiously and obviously stupid it is easy to ignore. And, gmail does a wonderful job of ensuring I deal with very little of it. However, once in a while something comes through. A trend I&#8217;ve noticed recently are emails that begin with &#8220;This is an advertisement&#8230;&#8221; I&#8217;ve never read one careful but it&#8217;s possible, but unlikely, that I somehow asked to receive it.</p>
<p>Today, I got an odd email. I first thought to dismiss it, but upon reading it I decided it was either the best crafted bit of spam, or an honest mistake. Then I was faced with a decision: round-file it, or be a good Samaritan and let the guy know. Here&#8217;s the email:</p>
<p>&gt;Subject: travel to Missoula</p>
<p>&gt;Thanks for getting the reservation at Downtown Motel.  The fellow I talked to said &#8220;no available rooms the entire weekend&#8221;.  I&#8217;ll put &gt;it on my credit card when I get there.</p>
<p>&gt;I&#8217;ve encountered another problem with scheduling.  I ordered my airline tickets through Priceline.Com and now they tell me there is no record of my order.  The airlines now want about $400 more because of the short notice.  Consequently, I&#8217;m going to drive and will pick up Quincy and your mother.  We will arrive sometime late Friday and stay through Sunday.  See you then.</p>
<p>&gt;                                         Love,  Uncle John</p>
<p>Ultimately, I decided to reply:</p>
<p>&gt;Hi John,</p>
<p>&gt;I&#8217;m sorry, but you&#8217;ve reached the wrong email box.</p>
<p>&gt;Forgive my suspicion, but if you do happen to be a spammer and are using this as a ploy to get a response from this email address, rest assured a real person lives here and I&#8217;ll haunt your sleep forever if you continue to spam me. However, also note that, if you are a spammer, all your future spam will flutter totally un-noticed by me into my big circular bit bucket to live out eternity in utter unacknowledgement.</p>
<p>&gt;Hope the trip goes well.</p>
<p>&gt;Cheers.</p>
<p>What do you think&#8212;was it spam? Would you have replied? The analogy is walking down the city street, only talking to our friends, eyeing with suspicion and from a distance any stranger we happen across. Do we need to recreate this dynamic on the tubes (pipes? I forget) as well, or can we allow for greater friendliness?<br />
