         <div class="entrybody"><p><strong>NOTE:</strong> <em>This is essentially a transcript of (though mostly written before)
my JSConf 2012 talk, &ldquo;Is Node.js better?&rdquo;. It&rsquo;s long, I know. There is no
tl;dr, sorry.</em></p>

<p><strong>Is this better than that?</strong></p>

<p>This is a question that we confront constantly. Numerous times a day, in fact.
And sometimes a lot rides on the answer. Is this job offer better than that
one? Is this car better than that one? Is this home for my ailing mother
better than that one? Is this billing system better than that one? Is this tax
plan better than that one?</p>

<p>This question is everywhere. We cannot escape it. Yet for the frequency with
which we confront it, our approach to resolving the question is quite likely
<em>not</em> objective. Which is to say, we are probably not answering the question
in a way that is mostly likely to benefit us. Many used car sales, software
system sales, and political campaigns, to mention a few things, profit from
our incompetence answering this question. We&rsquo;ll consider some of the reasons
why that is true later. But just recognizing this is rather distressing.</p>

<p>But we&rsquo;re not just asking, &ldquo;is this better than that?&rdquo; in general; we&rsquo;re here
at JSConf and this talk is about Node.js. Why? You probably know that I&rsquo;m not
a notable member of the Javascript community. I have not authored a single JS
library. I&rsquo;ve never given a talk at a JSConf. Why am I here? And why am I
talking about Node.js?</p>

<p>I met Chris Williams at <a href="http://codeconf.com/">CodeConf 2011</a>, organized by
<a href="https://github.com/">Github</a>. Chris sat down next to me during the Node.js
talk by Ryan Dahl. I found the talk fascinating because much of it focused on
improving the non-blocking I/O facilities in V8 for both Windows and Unix-ish
platforms. This was something that we have a lot of interest in for the
Rubinius project and I had then recently started porting Rubinius to Windows.</p>

<p>At the time, I had no idea who Chris was. But we chatted a bit and at the
break, Chris stood up and said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to get some more beer, would you
like some?&rdquo; Holy shit. <em>That&rsquo;s why I had been smelling beer for the last 45
minutes!</em> Chris had a coffee cup full of beer. Hilarious. One person&rsquo;s
moderation is another person&rsquo;s excess.</p>

<p>I declined the beer then but we exchanged contact info and Chris put me in
touch with folks from Microsoft who were assisting with getting Node.js
running well on Windows. Chris also informed me of the upcoming JSConf that
was being held in Portland, where I live. It was too late to get tickets but I
was able to attend the opening party and made a point to hang out as much as I
could with the other attendees at conference events. At the time of CodeConf,
I was merely curious about Node.js, but I didn&rsquo;t have much of an opinion.</p>

<p>Fast-forward almost nine months. I was seeing a flurry of tweets about
Node.js. This got my attention, in part because of the people who where
tweeting about it. I use Twitter as one of my main sources of information
about developing technology. The more tweets I saw, the more uneasy I felt.
Finally, one morning I posted this:</p>

<p><img src="/images/node_challenge.png" alt="Node.js challenge" /></p>

<p>My intent was not to be antagonistic. Rather, my challenge was focused on
finding out what sort of problems people were solving with Node.js. But any
challenge, even a sincere one, carries a connotation of aggressiveness. And it
is a fact of human nature that when pushed, people tend to push back. Some of
the responses to my tweet attempted to share knowledge but others were
understandably of the genre, &ldquo;if you&rsquo;re looking for a fight, you&rsquo;ll find one
here.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It wasn&rsquo;t long before Chris DM&rsquo;d me and basically said, &ldquo;What&rsquo;s up with this
&lsquo;challenge&rsquo;? You are working on important stuff, why are you wasting time on
this?&rdquo; I answered that I was genuinely interested in understanding why people
are using Node.js. We exchanged a few comments over a several days and Chris
asked if I was willing to do a talk on the subject. So that is how I got here,
talking about Node.js at JSConf. It is a honor and privilege to be here and I
thank Chris and the conference organizers, as well as all of you.</p>

<p>So who am I? I&rsquo;ve been working on the <a href="http://rubini.us">Rubinius</a> project for
the past five years, and four of those while employed full-time by <a href="http://engineyard.com">Engine
Yard</a>. I started the <a href="http://rubyspec.org">RubySpec</a>
project as part of my work on Rubinius. Through my work on Rubinius, I have
learned a lot about compilers, virtual machines, garbage collectors, and
importantly, concurrency. One of the notable points about Rubinius is we have
removed the global interpreter lock (GIL) so that multiple native threads can
run Ruby code in parallel on multi-core or multi-CPU hardware. We see this
ability as vital to the success of Rubinius.</p>

<p>Now that you know how I came to be speaking at JSConf and you know a little
about what I do, the question remains, &ldquo;<em>Why</em> am I speaking at JSConf? Why do
I care about Node.js?&rdquo; The answer to that will take us on a journey through
some interesting territory. I only ask that you suspend prejudice and follow
along. If you ultimately disagree with me, there is nothing wrong with that.</p>

<p><em>Organizations tend to perpetuate the problem they were created to solve.</em></p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t remember exactly when I was introduced to this idea, but it had a
significant effect on me. There are a lot of difficult problems to solve in
the world and one of the first things we tend to do is create an organization
that is dedicated to some aspect or another of a solution. Notice that there
is a difference between people organizing to solve a problem and an
organization. As soon as we have an organization, it will tend to take actions
to perpetuate itself. Of course, these actions are really the decisions of
people <em>in</em> the organization. The organization has no effective power
independent of the people who comprise it, yet the organization as a whole is
a system, and will tend to exhibit life-preserving actions. If an organization
exists to solve a problem, and that problem is solved, the organization ceases
to have a reason to exist.</p>

<p>Every time we organize for any reason, there is a tendency for structures to
solidify. The rigidity of those structures tend to inhibit movement and change
as circumstances change. Therefore, a vital force in social organization is
the force that opposes established order. There is a name for this force:
<em>subversive</em>, something seeking or intending to subvert an established system
or institution. People who participate in subversive activities are called
subversives.</p>

<p>There is another aspect to this that is important. People tend to be in one of
two groups: those who fear change and those who create change. When we think
of &ldquo;change&rdquo;, it usually has a positive connotation, and &ldquo;subversive&rdquo; has a
negative connotation. But they are often the same thing. Change can be
positive or negative. But as it has been said, &ldquo;there is only one constant:
change.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Javascript has been an amazing technology wielded by people who have radically
and fundamentally changed how we interact on the web. This is fascinating and
tremendously valuable for societies all over the world. So part of the reason
why I&rsquo;m speaking here is that people enthusiastic about Javascript are people
who are creating change. I want to acknowledge, assist, encourage, collaborate
with, and influence people who are actively working to change the world for
the better.</p>

<p>This talk is about conflict resolution. Conflict is inherent in the question,
&ldquo;Is this better than that?&rdquo;</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s important to note that any contrast implies conflict. Sometimes people
assert that you should be able to promote something without saying anything
bad about something else. This idea is impossible to comprehend. If I say,
&ldquo;water is good,&rdquo; it is inherent, even when implicit, that I&rsquo;m saying water has
value and value is a concept that relies on a context and a standard. There is
no concept of value that is not relational. Something is only good relative to
what you are judging it against.</p>

<p>Criticism is advocacy; advocacy is criticism. Criticism is also controversy
and controversy is entertaining. However, despite the entertainment value,
different ways of resolving conflict can have very negative consequences.
Usually when there is conflict, we address it with aggression. We talk about
having a &ldquo;shootout&rdquo;, &ldquo;fight&rdquo;, &ldquo;throw down&rdquo;, etc. But are fights a healthy,
beneficial way to resolve controversy?</p>

<p>Further, when a person comes out as a strong advocate for some technology,
people opposed to the technology will hurl the epithet &ldquo;fanboi&rdquo; as an attempt
to discredit the idea by attacking the person. From the other direction, if we
don&rsquo;t like someone&rsquo;s criticism, we may call the person a &ldquo;troll&rdquo;.</p>

<p>Other times, we will simply attempt to avoid conflict entirely. In Ruby, there
is this idea, MINASWAN: <em>Matz is nice and so we are nice.</em> There is nothing
wrong with being nice, but why is &ldquo;nice&rdquo; contrasted with &ldquo;criticism&rdquo;? Are we
supposed to never challenge someone because being &ldquo;nice&rdquo; is more important and
challenging them is inherently not nice?  What if someone is doing something
that from our experience is not beneficial to themselves or others?</p>

<p>For the most part, this is how I see us dealing with conflict. We either avoid
it or we attempt to devalue the person rather than discuss the idea. This is
dysfunctional. Basically, we suck at conflict.</p>

<p>How can we improve how we deal with conflict?</p>

<p>I assert that we need to use science. But how? What does that mean? To
understand this, we need to look more deeply at how we as humans think. But
before we get to that, let&rsquo;s consider a very common aspect of social
organization: the tendency to surrender our own judgment to that of an
&ldquo;expert&rdquo;.</p>

<p>In 1948, Alex Osborn, who was an ad man at B.B.D.O., wrote a book, <em>Your
Creative Power</em>, where he introduced &ldquo;brainstorming&rdquo;. Essentially, a group of
people toss out solutions to a problem under consideration. The emphasis is on
generating as many ideas as possible. A key element of the activity is that
everyone is told not to criticize their own or other&rsquo;s ideas. It was asserted
that creativity was too delicate a process to withstand the harsh light of a
critical challenge.</p>

<p>Of course, that made a lot of sense to people. Over the years, brainstorming
has been used extensively in problem solving. It is still heavily used. The
problem is, the method is flawed. The proscription against criticism happens
to be wrong.</p>

<p>There were two studies that tested the two main components of the
brainstorming methodology for discovering creative solutions. The first
focused on individuals versus groups. The result was that people working alone
produced not just more but better ideas than the groups.</p>

<p>The second study focused on the suspension of criticism. The subjects were
divided into three groups. The first group were instructed to use
brainstorming and told not to criticize their own or each other&rsquo;s ideas. The
second group were instructed to challenge and debate one another. The last
group was allowed to organize themselves without any instruction in a
particular method. The results from this experiment were unambiguous. The
debaters significantly outscored both other groups. The act of criticizing
other&rsquo;s ideas causes both the questioner to understand the idea more fully and
the person proposing the idea to go more deeply into it.</p>

<p>The important lesson is two-fold. Criticism is an important aspect of
creative, intellectual effort. Despite the proscription against criticism
having superficial validity, it was rather easily disproved.</p>

<p>Another interesting study related to creativity examined whether there was a
correlation between the success of Broadway musicals and how well the team
producing the musical knew each other. The measure of team familiarity was
named the Q factor. A team where all the members had worked together before
would have a high Q factor. A team where no members had worked together before
would have a low Q factor. The study found that there was indeed a significant
statistical correlation between Q factor and success of a musical. In other
words, a certain range of Q factor was a good predictor of success. The value
of Q that was most likely to predict success was from a team where most
members had worked together previously but some members had not. A team where
no one had worked together wasn&rsquo;t able to communicate effectively enough. A
team where everyone had worked together didn&rsquo;t benefit from an outsider&rsquo;s
perspective challenging ideas.</p>

<p>These results are reported in <em>Groupthink: The Brainstorming Myth</em> by Jonah
Lehrer, published in <em>New Yorker</em> magazine, January 30th, 2012. The lesson we
can take is that criticism is important to creative solutions to problems and
we should be seeking people who are unfamiliar with our favorite language or
framework to join us and help our understanding of problems and the solutions
we are building.</p>

<p>Another lesson is that there is nothing that prevents a well-meaning and
experienced expert from being wrong. One thing that we should all be
challenging is &ldquo;appeals to authority&rdquo; in decision making. As you can see from
the following tweet, Ward Cunningham thinks Node.js is the future of the
server side. However, that assertion is most likely not taken by readers of
the tweet as a neutral assertion of fact about Ward&rsquo;s opinion. It is taken as
meaningful because Ward said it. Further, it is unremarkable that the
assertion is unaccompanied by any evidence with which to help determine the
validity of the assertion. Assertions by experts with no accompanying evidence
are the <em>status quo</em> in our industry, and that should be extremely
embarrassing.</p>

<p><img src="/images/node_future.png" alt="Appeal to authority" /></p>

<p>The next part of our journey takes us to one of the most interesting books I
have read. <em>Thinking Fast and Slow</em> by Daniel Kahneman (Farrar, Straus and
Giroux, 2011) is a book about how our minds work. There are basically two
modes that have distinct and surprising features in the way we think. These
two modes influence one another.</p>

<p>One mode is called fast thinking because our brains activate an entire network
of associations in a sub-second burst of activity. For example, if I display
the word &ldquo;bacon&rdquo;, you will immediately have numerous memories and associations
with bacon coming into awareness. This fast mode is all about pattern matching
and the associations activated can be extensive and surprising. In this mode,
the brain over-achieves, if you will. It activates far more associations than
may be needed. And some associations may be surprising. It is up to the second
mode to use those associations depending on the task we are confronted with.</p>

<p>The other mode is called slow thinking and is related to such activities as
concentration, judgment, monitoring, and selecting. If I ask, &ldquo;what is 23 x
47?&rdquo; Answering this requires deliberate application of a set of tasks to
arrive at the answer, unless the problem is one we are quite familiar with,
in which case the fast thinking would just produce the answer as an
association.</p>

<p>The book is filled with fascinating knowledge about how our thinking works and
I cannot recommend it highly enough. It discusses numerous ways in which our
thinking can produce erroneous beliefs and ideas. One of the very interesting
results is that our deliberate, slow thinking can be easily fooled into
accepting a wrong answer provided by our fast thinking mode if we feel at
ease. But if we feel anxious, our slow thinking mode will be more critical and
less likely to just accept an answer provided by our fast thinking mode.</p>

<p>Reading <em>Thinking Fast and Slow</em> and reflecting on the complex and
inter-related behaviors that scientists have been able to discover facts about
led me to the following conclusion:</p>

<p><em>Programming is a behavioral science.</em></p>

<p>Behavioral science is a very broad category that encompasses disciplines that
explore the activities and interactions among organisms through systematic
analysis and investigation using controlled observation and scientific
experimentation.</p>

<p>There is a distinction between programming and computer science. Writing
software is an activity that is mostly centered on human behaviors. Most
software will interact with people at some point. Basically, it is written by
people, for people, and funded by people. Of course, there are mathematical
foundations of computing and algorithms, but those are rarely the most
important elements of the process of creating software.</p>

<p>If you are familiar with the many methodologies under the &ldquo;Agile&rdquo; umbrella,
you know that dealing with changing requirements is one of the most complex
aspects of software construction. But note that those changes are almost
entirely due to human behaviors. If we build a bridge, an environmental study
will determine most of the forces that the bridge design must account for.
Further, the laws of physics are quite well established. Engineering the
bridge is not a terribly complex activity. However, in software, there is not
a good way to clearly establish the constraints for the system we are
building. People are responsible for most of the complexity in programming.
That is why I assert it is a behavioral science.</p>

<p>What is curious to me is that a typical undergrad psychology student will
likely have more exposure to research methods than a typical computer science
undergrad or even graduate student. Research methods are activities directed
at determining the <em>validity</em> of assertions. They are what enable us to
separate knowledge from opinion. Fundamentally, they are related to two
aspects of existence: the nature of the world (meta-physics) and the theory of
knowledge (epistemology). To learn more about this, I would recommend
<em>Research Methods: the basics</em> by Nicholas Walliman (Routledge 2011).</p>

<p>Turning from this general information about applying science to thinking and
learning about research methods, let&rsquo;s look at Node.js again. One of the major
assertions about Node.js is that it permits writing efficient web servers that
must deal with many concurrent connections. So, let&rsquo;s look at some basic
features of concurrency, including a possible definition of concurrency.</p>

<p><em>People are selfish, lazy, and easily bored.</em></p>

<p>I say that without any moral judgment. I think these are all biologically
desirable features of organisms. We are selfish because we are responsible for
our own well-being. We are lazy so we don&rsquo;t waste precious and
costly-to-obtain energy. We are easily bored because we must constantly
incorporate new material to maintain our existence. Of course, each of these
attributes has an opposite and any individual will exhibit a combination of
these behaviors. But these three attributes are interesting to consider in
this context.</p>

<p>Scarcity is a fact of life. Infinity is a mathematical fantasy. There are a
finite number of computers.</p>

<p>Combine scarcity with the attributes above about people and we have a reason
for concurrency in computation.</p>

<p>When a single CPU with a single core is running, it can basically execute one
instruction at a time. Of course, this is a simplification, but it is
basically true. If we consider a program to be a sequence of instructions,
I<sub>1</sub>..I<sub>n</sub>, every possible ordering of those instructions is
a plausible definition of concurrency. For example, a four instruction program
could be I<sub>1</sub>, I<sub>2</sub>, I<sub>3</sub>, I<sub>4</sub> or
I<sub>3</sub>, I<sub>1</sub>, I<sub>2</sub>, I<sub>4</sub>, etc. Not all
orderings are going to be meaningful given the semantics we expect from the
program.</p>

<p>Now, consider that the program would be 100% efficient if all the instructions
are dedicated to solving the problem for which the program exists. However, if
any instructions are dedicated to changing the order of instructions, those
would reduce the efficiency of the program by doing work that is not directly
related to solving the problem.</p>

<p>Once upon a time, computers solved problems one at a time. The jobs were
processed from start to finish one at a time. This is great for efficiency but
not great for people. People don&rsquo;t want to wait for everyone else&rsquo;s job to
finish before theirs. Nor are they willing to do a lot of extra work to make
the computer most efficient. So the idea of time-sharing systems was born.
Essentially, everyone got a little slice of time to use the CPU. Even though
some efficiency was lost, and so everyone&rsquo;s program would ultimately take
longer to complete, the average time to wait went from hours (a whole day,
perhaps) to possibly a few minutes. Computers became interactive.</p>

<p>There are only a few mechanisms to re-order the instructions of a sequential
program. (Note that we can generalize from the instructions of a single
program to the instructions of a set of programs concatenated together. The
fundamental considerations do not change.) One way would be to do a little
work and then voluntarily yield control of the CPU to another program.  At
some later time, another program would yield control back to us. This would
implement cooperative multitasking. Another way would be for some sort of
supervisor to allocate a short amount of time to each program in sequence.
This would implement pre-emptive multitasking. Once your time-slice is over,
you simply have to wait until everyone else gets a time-slice before you can
run again. Yet another way would be to allow a program to run until it
performed some action, like writing to the display or reading from the disk.</p>

<p>Each of these mechanisms for interleaving the instructions of a serial program
may have different trade-offs, and consequently, different efficiencies.
However, there is nothing inherent in any method that dictates it would be
more efficient than any other. I consider this a very important point missing
from almost every assertion about the uniqueness of Node.js. People are
saying, and others are repeating, that Node.js enables solutions that are not
possible with other programming languages and frameworks. This is absolutely
false.</p>

<p>There is a lot more to understand about concurrency, modern CPUs, and
efficiency than we can cover here. However, if you are concerned with the
validity of the assertion that Node.js is good technology for writing
efficient web servers, then you may want to understand more about concurrency.</p>

<p>Besides concurrency, there are a number of justifications given for using
Node.js. Are these justifications valid? I think consistency is important. If
I say X is better than some Y because of some reason J, and there is some X&rsquo;
that is basically equivalent to X and Y&rsquo; equivalent to Y, then X&rsquo; should
probably be better than Y&rsquo; for the same reason J. That idea is expressed in
symbols below, where the long horizontal line means that the statements above
logically <em>imply</em> the statement below the line.</p>

<p><img src="/images/justification.png" alt="Justification" /></p>

<p>One reason given for using Node.js is that the same language, Javascript, can
be used on both the client and the server. If that is true, then why shouldn&rsquo;t
someone use <a href="https://developers.google.com/web-toolkit/">GWT</a> and use Java on
both the client and server? Since the JVM works very well on the server,
certainly the effort put into GWT could be seen as the equivalent of the
effort put into Node.js to make a browser technology work well on the server.
At the least, when you hear the &ldquo;same language&rdquo; justification, you should be
looking for places where the same justification could be made but you don&rsquo;t
find it convincing. If the justification isn&rsquo;t convincing when you substitute
analogous elements, then either the justification is flawed or it is missing
something that would differentiate the two situations.</p>

<p>Often, the same language justification for using Node.js is promoted by people
who are also bragging about being polyglot programmers. Not only is knowing
more than one programming language beneficial, it&rsquo;s basically required these
days. But if knowing more than one language is offered as a positive, why is
it important to use the same language on client and server? I&rsquo;m not saying
this argument is invalid, but rather that the justification should examined
for consistency.</p>

<p>Another reason given for using Node.js is that there are many Javascript
programmers. However, statistically, that means there are many mediocre or
poor quality Javascript programmers. And if concurrent applications are so
hard, do you want a lot of mediocre or poor programmers building them? Again,
many Javascript programmers <em>may</em> be a justification for using Node.js but by
itself, the justification is problematic. It&rsquo;s likely an extreme
over-simplification. As such, it has dubious value as more than just a
convenient dismissal of someone who challenges the rationale for using
Node.js.</p>

<p>It may be that using Node.js is just more fun for many people. This is a great
reason to use Node.js. However, it is not one that can be used to evaluate the
technical merit of the technology. Which is fine. Recall that I&rsquo;m asserting
programming is a <em>behavioral</em> science. We should be studying and giving
adequate weight to considerations that are not merely technical. Humans are
using Node.js.</p>

<p>Finally, despite being controversial, I&rsquo;m going to give some opinions about
Node.js based on my experience. The point is not whether you believe me or
not.  These opinions should be examined critically with the objective of
determining their validity using methods suggested above.</p>

<p>More CPU cores is the trend for the future. Typical programs have a huge
amount of state. Every library loaded is program state. Running multiple
processes demands duplicating the memory used by each process times the
number of running processes. As long as the total memory needed to saturate
the CPU cores is less than the memory available, using processes should not be
a problem. However, we have seen in Ruby, at least, that it is not typically
the case. Memory pressure is a constant problem. Solutions to this memory
pressure like copy-on-write (CoW) friendly garbage collection are hard and not
guaranteed to be that effective. If the mutable part of the heap is small
then there is also very likely little shared state that would complicate
simply using threads. If the mutable part is large, you get the same memory
pressure over time regardless of CoW-friendly GC.</p>

<p>Since it is extremely unlikely that Javascript will add threads to the
standard, Node.js will either be essentially single-threaded or programs will
use non-standard libraries to introduce threading. This forces Node.js to use
process concurrency to achieve parallelism. In this respect, I think that
Node.js rejects the multi-core reality that confronts us.</p>

<p>In fact, Node.js is already confronting the issue of process concurrency. In
Ruby, we have <a href="http://www.modrails.com/">Passenger</a> for managing multiple
worker processes.  There is now a similar system for Node.js called
<a href="http://learnboost.github.com/cluster/">Cluster</a>.</p>

<p>Another concern is that an entire ecosystem of libraries and tools must be
built up for Node.js. Javascript was confined to the browser of a long time,
and that environment is quite impoverished. In building those libraries, many
mistakes that have been make in other languages will be made again. That is
simply the nature of humans doing work. We make mistakes. Ruby and other
languages have repeated mistakes from languages that came before them. I&rsquo;m not
saying that the work that must be done won&rsquo;t be offset by its future value. I
am saying the work must be done and its value should be questioned. There is
always an opportunity cost for choosing to do an activity. It is the cost of
not doing another activity. In attempting to answer the question whether
Node.js is better for our problem, we must consider these issues.</p>

<p>Concurrency is definitely a concern for practically every currently popular
programming language. If you have heard that Node.js enables solutions not
possible in other languages, I encourage you to look more deeply into the
situation. In Ruby, I recommend checking out the
<a href="https://github.com/celluloid">Celluloid</a> project by Tony Arcieri. The
project&rsquo;s aim is to bring various concurrency mechanisms to Ruby. He is
someone with a lot of experience and accomplishments and I&rsquo;m confident his
projects will advance the state of the art in Ruby and hopefully other
languages as well. If you are a Clojure enthusiast, you may want to look at
Carl Lerche&rsquo;s <a href="https://github.com/momentumclj/momentum">momentum</a> project. Of
course, there are many languages and frameworks that handle concurrency and
more are under active development. Node.js is not new technology; it&rsquo;s merely
new for Javascript.</p>

<p>Ultimately, the answer to, &ldquo;Is Node.js better?&rdquo; is not that important. People
will use Node.js even if it&rsquo;s not the best solution to their problem. Other
people will not use it even if it is great for their particular problem. Both
results limit the benefits available to all of us. Further, we will continue
to confront the question, &ldquo;is this better than that?&rdquo; If we improve our
ability to answer that question, hopefully we will increase the benefit to us
all.</p>
