For the second time in a few days, lighttpd went awol on me. All that shows in the logs is 'graceful shutdown started', then 'server stopped'. The VDS is fine and dandy, showing up-time of 26+ days. And the rails fcgi processes are all fine as well.

Perhaps this is a good time to give [Mongrel](http://mongrel.rubyforge.org/) a whirl. There's been interest expressed around the [office](http://www.planetargon.com), especially after [Redhanded's](http://redhanded.hobix.com/cult/zedGoesOffAboutMongrel.html) quote from the interview with Zed Shaw about Mongrel using a parser based on a real grammar and parser generator, [Ragel](http://www.cs.queensu.ca/~thurston/ragel/).

Alas, this bit of sysadmin has eaten the few minutes for my intended post, so I'll leave you with just the teaser of a title for the next post...
