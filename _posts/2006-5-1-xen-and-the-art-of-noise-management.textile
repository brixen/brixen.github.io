title: Xen and the art of noise (management)

While I definitely appreciate the folks at [Textdrive](http://www.textdrive.com) for being early, and continuing, supporters of [Rails](www.rubyonrails.com), I recently decided to switch to a VDS for essentially the same reasons as [Octopod](http://outside-thoughts.octopod.info/articles/2006/02/22/why-the-move). Actually, I have him to thank for that little extra nudge provided by his blog entry. I hadn't given the idea much thought until then because it seemed like overkill for hosting a couple personal sites. Silly me.

After quite a bit of research, I decided to go with [Quantact](http://www.quantact.com) as well. And thanks to Ezra's great [tutorial](http://brainspl.at/rails_stack.html), I'm up and enjoying myself a lot. Well, mostly. I decided to use Debian 3.1, which I've never used before. However, since I've been using [Ubuntu](www.ubuntu.com) for the past several months (which was a pretty big switch after RH and Fedora for years), the process was mostly painless. The one area I'm not real comfortable with is the firewall. I'm using Bastille, but I haven't closed the book on that yet. Actually, the idea that's pinging around in my head is: I wonder how it would work to use Rake to write the rules for iptables. Has anyone tried something like this? I'll let you know what I discover.

Okay, you might be wondering how the title fits in here. If you've checked out [Quantact](http://www.quantact.com), you may have noticed they are using [Xen](http://www.xensource.com/) for the VDS. Impressive technology. The rest? Well, when evaluating what I was finding most unsatisfactory about shared hosting, I realized it was the "noise". All these processes, all these directories, all this stuff going on that had nothing to do with me. I was spending a lot of time in that noise, especially that webmin interface when I just wanted to type a few lines and be done. Now ps aux fills less than one screen of my xterm. I don't think about special cases or file tickets for a port. Mind you, I'm not saying Textdrive has it all wrong. I'm just saying, my Xen VDS is nice and quiet.
